<h1>The web browser you are using is ancient and extinct... like the dinosaurs.</h1>
<p>Internet Explorer Sux (6) is every web designers' worst enemy, not to mention being insecure and prone to collecting adware and trojans. It is also not supported by Microsoft anymore. Please upgrade to one of these:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/">Mozilla Firefox</a> <--Recommended</li>
<li><a href="http://www.apple.com/safari/download/">Safari</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.google.com/chrome">Google Chrome</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.opera.com/">Opera</a></li>
</ul>
<p>It is quick, easy to do and this message will disappear after you have upgraded. An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.
