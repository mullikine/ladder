This is a website comprising of PHP scripts I made to host tournaments
for the Mac Age of Empires II community.

See the website in action:

Notable scripts:
[Online / Offline player scanner with simultaneous queries (too fast == D.O.S.)](https://github.com/mullikine/ladder/blob/master/online-scanner-curl-multi.php)
